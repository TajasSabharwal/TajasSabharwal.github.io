Hello, My name is Tajas (like contagious) but alot of my friends call me TJ. I am a recent graduate from the University of Calgary with a bachelors degree in business analytics. Growing up I was always facsinated with computers, technology, and money, so the business analytics program called to me immediatly when I learned of it. When I'm not writing code or looking at spredsheets you can find me out on the golf course, cheering on the Oilers, or reading classic novels.
